## ADR N: First Contact

### Context
The time elapsed since I departed from this base has resulted in the increment of each module through the command /domain/entities. 

### Decision
Each entity is empowered to independently enhance the code, adopting distinct responsibilities.

### Consequences
This type of strategy is useful for working parallelly and delivering CI/CD continuously with incremental releases of high-value features to the business.
